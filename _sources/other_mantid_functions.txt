Workspaces
==========

Workspaces hold the data in Mantid. They come in several forms, but the most common is
the Matrix Workspace which represents XYE data for one or more spectra. In MantidPlot the
data contained in a workspace can viewed as a matrix or a table, and graphed in many ways
including Line graphs, contour plots and 3D graphs.

Interaction with workspaces is typically through an interface. Matrix Workspaces are
typically created by executing one of Mantid's 'Load' algorithms or are the output of
algorithms which take a Matrix Workspace as input.

In addition to data, workspaces hold a workspace history, which details the algorithms
which have been run on this workspace.

When a muon data set is loaded, the Matrix Workspaces are created automatically. The workspace 
list pane is found on the right-hand side of the main MantidPlot window.

**MuonAnalysis**, holds within it raw positron counts / us for each individual detector.
To examine the data collected in a single detector, right click on workspace MuonAnalysis and select Plot Spectrum.
There is one spectrum per detector. In the window that opens up you can enter the number of the spectrum/detector
that you want to plot; you can also enter a range or plot all spectra.

**MuonAnalysisGrouped** contains data in raw counts / us but collated 
as specified under the Grouping Options tab of the interface.

**NAMENUMBER** a third workspace with a name depending on instrument name and run number is created.
Within this workspace there are two sub-workspaces, one of them with the suffix RAW. These sub-workspaces
are also contain the Group in their name, this is the name of the grouping options specified in the 
*Grouping Options* tab of the interface. RAW contains un-binned raw data.

In general the muon analysis GUI hides workspaces from the user; however, an
understanding of their functionality is sometimes useful to take advantage of some of the
more advanced features of MantidPlot. In particular, for those seeking to develop a
specialist analysis method, the GUI can be used for the initial data reduction with user
coded Python or C++ algorithms acting on workspaces to process the final result. This type
of hybrid workflow demonstrates the versatility of the MantidPlot interface.

Other types of object, such as Tables, Matrices and Notes, may be created through the
MantidPlot interface. As these are not workspaces the Algorithms can’t directly be applied.
However, Tables may be converted the either a Table or Matrix workspace through an
option on the analysis menu for subsequent data processing. For instance, converting the
Results Table to a matrix workspace enables MantidPlot fitting the be carried out (however,
see section III below for an alternative method of analysing results using the QtiPlot fitting).

Loading Data
============

Matrix Workspaces are typically created by executing one of Mantid's 'Load' algorithms or are 
the output of algorithms which take a Matrix Workspace as input. In addition to data, workspaces 
hold a workspace history which lists the algorithms that have been applied to the data.

We will load a raw data file WITHOUT USING the Mantid Analysis GUI and examine its content:

In the MantidPlot ‘Workspaces’ pane (see below) use the LOAD button to import file

.. figure:: /images/LoadWorkspace.png

Click on the ‘arrow’ beside the file name – this allows information about the format of
data file to be viewed. The following should be seen in the Workspace List pane to
the right of the screen.

We find that a workspace called HIFI00062798 is created and ...

* is a 2D array
* the data has been collected from a silver calibration measurement taken in a transverse field of 20G
* it contains 64 spectra (or histograms i.e. one for each HiFi detector)
* there are 2048 time channels, or bins, per plot

However, the NeXuS format allows a lot more information be stored in a data file than that listed above. As an example

right click on the file name and select ‘Sample Logs’. A list of experiment and
instrument parameters that have been logged during a measurement, from
magnetic fields to sample temperatures, appears.

To interrogate any of these logs double click on the ‘Name’.

Examine Temp_Cryostat – the plot below should appear. Explore other parameter files

.. figure:: /images/TempCrysostat.png

As mentioned, since we have simply loaded HIFI00062798.nxs, workspace, HIFI00062798
holds within it raw positron counts / bin for EACH individual HiFi detector. To examine the
data collected in a single detector, right click on HIFI00062798 and select Plot Spectrum.

On HiFi, as way of example, there are 64 detectors hence ID numbers: 1-64 (1-32 =
upstream detectors, 33-64 = downstream detectors.

Enter a detector (ID) number of your choice and click OK to plot the associated raw data.


For information:

* ARGUS has 192 detectors (usually pre-grouped to 32 histograms in the data analysis software)
* MuSR and HIFI have 64 detectors (usually pre-grouped to 32 histograms in the data analysis software)
* EMu has 96 detectors (usually pre-grouped to 32 histograms in the data analysis software)
Exporting Data
==============

To export the data contained within any listed workspace click on the Algorithms tab at the bottom of the workspace list pane.
The SaveAscii dialog is shown below. You can choose which workspace to save, where to save it and how to separate columns in 
the resulting file.

.. algorithm_image:: SaveAscii


QtiPlot
=======

Enabling QtiPlot allows data sets and workspaces to be analysed using a suite of inbuilt
Origin fitting algorithms. To enable QtiPlot follow View > Preferences > Fitting. The following
window should appear. Select Enable QtiPlot Fitting

.. figure:: /images/StartQti.png

When QtiPlot fitting has been enabled, and a data file has been loaded, Analysis appears in the list of options above the main MantidPlot window toolbar.


Overlaying Data
===============

To overlay data, select the plot window in which you wish to compare data. Right click on
the plot window and select Add/Remove Curve. A list of available data sets will appear. As
an example, below we have the option of adding the data contained in the workspace
EMU00020886; Group=long; Asym; #1 to the plot window of EMU00020897; Group=long;
Asym; #1. To do so, first select EMU00020886; Group=long; Asym; #1 in the left hand pane
and then click the ‘right’ pointing arrow. Reversing this process removes data from a plot
window. The plot style (line, scatter, line+scatter etc) of the added data set can be selected using the New Curves Style drop 
down menu at the top of the Add/Remove Curve window
